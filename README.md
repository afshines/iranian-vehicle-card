# YOLO

YOLO â€” You Only Look Once, is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. 

YOLO can do object detection + object classification + multiple object detection all at the same time. Assuming each information in our ID card is an object, we used YOLO to identify the bounding boxes for this information.

We use Yolo v3 in this project.
